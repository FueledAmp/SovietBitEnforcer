# What Is The Soviet Bit Enforcer? 
This ransomware application ONLY works for operating systems running Windows, after the generated file has been ran on the targeted device, it has the ability to encrypt all files on drive, of your preference, you can also make the Soviet display a message to the device via an Image of your liking. If the said person doesn't comply with the orders given by you, program will slowly start deleting files by hour, so it doesn't just take a simple ransomware approach to it like most, it'll play on the person's character, with this hint of social engineering in the mix which it makes it hard to deny the ransom. Note the program was written by me in 2017, still think it's a cool piece a of work to bring back for moment...


# A Russian's Say On Philisophy
I've been fascinated by Cyber security, and malware development since the age of 9, it had seemed to catch my eye, and to this day it does... Now, as much as it's important creating security/monitoring based tools and frameworks for our blue team community out here. I feel like it's a necessity for us who find these things as a career or interest, that we can agree, that it's good to get a little taste of both sides, it inforces good InfoSec, and especially with the things going on through out this pandemic. That we just simply never know the real outcomes of things we're talking part in today, and how they could turn around within a night.
